# Risk Register Project

This project demonstrates my understanding of **risk identification, analysis, and mitigation** aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview
A risk register is a core GRC document that tracks potential threats, their likelihood and impact, and the controls used to mitigate them.  
This sample register is based on a mock mid-sized company using cloud systems and employee endpoints.

---

## ðŸ§® Methodology
- Likelihood and Impact are rated on a 1â€“5 scale  
- Risk Score = Likelihood Ã— Impact  
- Controls are mapped to **NIST CSF** categories  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Risks Identified
| Asset | Risk | Risk Score | Control |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| Employee Workstations | Phishing | 20 (High) | Awareness training |
| HR Data | Data Breach | 15 (Medium) | Encryption controls |

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
- Risk registers help prioritize remediation efforts  
- Mapping risks to frameworks shows alignment with compliance goals  
- Regular review ensures risk posture remains current
